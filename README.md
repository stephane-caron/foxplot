Plot time-series data from [newline-delimited JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_streaming#Newline-delimited-JSON).

## Installation

```console
pip install foxplot
```

## Usage

Foxplot starts in interactive mode by default, which allows you to explore the input ``data`` (tab completion works) and plot times series from it using the ``foxplot`` function. For instance:

```python
$ foxplot upkie_2023-05-03-103245.mpack
Python 3.8.10 (default, Mar 13 2023, 10:26:41)

In [1]: foxplot(
   ...:     [
   ...:         data.observation.servo.left_knee.position,
   ...:         data.observation.servo.left_wheel.position,
   ...:     ],
   ...:     right=[
   ...:         data.observation.servo.left_knee.velocity,
   ...:         data.observation.servo.left_wheel.velocity,
   ...:     ],
   ...: )
New tab opened in your web browser! The command line is to produce it directly is:

foxplot upkie_2023-05-03-103245.mpack -l /observation/servo/left_knee/torque /observation/servo/left_wheel/torque -r /observation/servo/left_knee/velocity /observation/servo/left_wheel/velocity
```

We can also plot data from files and pipes directly, for example:

- JSON: ``foxplot my_data.json -l /observation/cpu_temperature``
- MessagePack: ``foxplot my_data.mpack -l /observation/cpu_temperature``

## Tips

Zsh users can filter foxplot completion on JSON and MessagePack files:

```zsh
zstyle ":completion:*:*:foxplot:*" ignored-patterns "^*.(json|mpack)"
```
