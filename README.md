# foxplot

[![Build](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/stephane-caron/foxplot/CI.yml?branch=main)](https://github.com/stephane-caron/foxplot/actions)

Plot time-series data from [line-delimited JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_streaming#Line-delimited_JSON).

Foxplot stands for "Frequent Observation diXionary (hum!) plots". Frequent observations arise from robotic control loops, our initial use case. Dictionaries are the representation used in [Vulp ðŸ¦Š](https://github.com/tasts-robots/vulp). Plots are plots.

## Usage

### JSON files

```console
$ foxplot my_time_series.json
```

### MessagePack files

```console
rq -mJ < my_time_series.mpack | jq '{.my.filters.here}' | foxplot
```

## Design notes

* Foxplot prioritizes ease-of-use (interactive mode) over performance
